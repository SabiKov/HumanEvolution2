 Breif Summary of the Game
 
The game is a learning adventure game for children,
through which they take on the role of The Guardian of the Book.
They are trusted with 'The Chronicles of Man',
a book charting man's progress through the ages.
The book's pages have become scattered by a careless
apprentice and the Guardian must retrieve the pages from their relevant eras.
