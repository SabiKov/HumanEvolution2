The primary goal is to implement a complex C# based code with adopting an Object-Oriantated Design approach. As a result, the game includes the following two important features (source codes).

The first one is the inventory system which consists of the following assests: inventory bag, game item object, healt bar panel, score panel, level transitions mechanism between scenes. The primary goals was to demonstrate a C# based source code. It is based on Model-View-Controller design pattern with including base classes (interface and abstract classes). Each "game object" has its own controller.cs class thus the code is expandable in other words more features can be implemented easily.

The second is the AI-NPC spawner system. The main feature of this is the spawned game objects (NPC) are automatized.

 Breif Summary of the Game
 
The game is a learning adventure game for children,
through which they take on the role of The Guardian of the Book.
They are trusted with 'The Chronicles of Man',
a book charting man's progress through the ages.
The book's pages have become scattered by a careless
apprentice and the Guardian must retrieve the pages from their relevant eras.
